"# HCSR04ArduinoMatlab" 
Here you will find a bunch of code that corresponds to what is done in this video https://youtu.be/v9ME5EYyA5c

Basically, we are playing here with Arduino and a sensor HCSR04.
This is one of the cheapest sensors you can find out there still kind of useful. 
There are a lot of documentation about how to use it so, I agree, this code here does not add any extra value (the video is kind of illustrative though). 

I enjoy code-based-representing stuff so that this is just another excuse for me to play around with Matlab code. 

In principle, everything should be in place. 
If you plan to give it a try to the Matlab, be sure you add to the path all needed folders--functions and classes.
